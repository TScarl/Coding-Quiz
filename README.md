# Coding-Quiz

## Coding quiz Introduction
This is a short, 5 question multiple choice quiz which is meant to test your knowledge of JS. The quiz is timed and the faster you can answer all of the questions the better your score will be. You will be rewarded for correct answers and penalised for incorrect answers.

## Usage Instructions (for end-users)
navigat to the webpage at: .... and notice the very sleek styling on the webpage! Once down admiring the beauty of it all, click on the "start quiz" button. Clicking the button will initialise the game and set the clock to ticking. Now just answer the questions to the best of your abilities and enjoy the good fun of learning! Once you finish answering the questions you will be prompted to insert you initials so your score can be recorded. Feel free to take the test multiple times and try to beat your highscore.

## Known issues
...There are quite a few issues still left. I struggled with this assignment quite a bit, and really just ran out of time in the end. Very annoying to not get it better.
1. The timer is being displayed even before you press the start button (probably easy fix).
2. No scores are shown after you enter your initials. They are recorded in the localStorage though, fortunately (very annoying).
3. All scores are recorded into the one string in localStorage, i couldn't work out how to get a new string to print each time (probably just missing a line or 2).
4. Nothing is shown in the highscores.html... atleast the back button is functional (ugghhhhhh).
5. I didn't manage to get the replay button to quite work (haven't looked at this in a little while... i'm not sure why it isn't working).

### Conclusion
For the most part it functions pretty well as a quiz, just the scoring and localStorage got me in the end.
